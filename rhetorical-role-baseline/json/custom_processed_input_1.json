JOHN ...APPELLANT (S)\nVERSUS\nSTATE OF U.P. & ANR. \u2026RESPONDENT(S)\nJ U D G M E N T\nNONGMEIKAPAM KOTISWAR SINGH, J.\nLeave granted.\n2. The present appeal has been preferred being aggrieved by the\njudgment dated 22.09.2023 passed by the High Court of Judicature at\nAllahabad under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n(\u2018CrPC\u2019 for short) in Application No. 35311 of 2023 by which the\nappellant\u2019s plea for quashing of the chargesheet No.162 of 2015 dated\n20.06.2015, order dated 11.08.2015 taking cognizance and issuing\nsummons, and the entire proceedings in Case No. 9790 of 2015 arising out\nof Case Crime No. 290 of 2015 under Sections 353 and 186 of the Indian \nPage 2 of 27\nPenal Code, 1860 (\u2018IPC\u2019 for short), P.S. Cantt. District Varanasi, U.P., was\nrejected.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n3. It is the plea of the appellant that he is the owner of the premises and\nwas in charge of managing & maintaining the hostel, which was being\noperated by a Non-Governmental Organization, named Sampoorna\nDevelopment India. This hostel at the relevant time was used for\nunderprivileged children by providing facilities for their accommodation,\neducation and other needs.\n3.1 According to the appellant, because of certain personal disputes with\none K.V. Abraham, the latter instituted six false cases against him, four of\nthem resulted in his acquittal, while in the other two discharge applications\nare pending. According to the appellant, it was at the instance of the said\nAbraham that the officials conducted a raid in the said hostel arbitrarily\nwithout authorization and also without providing any prior notice, alleging\nthat provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)\nAct, 2015 (\u2018JJ Act\u2019 for short) as applicable then, were not followed in\nrunning and managing the said hostel.\n3.2 It is the allegation of the appellant that the officials illegally\nconducted the raid on 03.06.2015 and sought to transfer the children\naccommodated in the said hostel to some other location purportedly on the\nground that the hostel was being run without proper authorization from the\ncompetent authority under the JJ Act.\n3.3. It was further contended that a false allegation was made against the\nappellant that he, along with his party, had attacked and assaulted the\nofficials while they were conducting the raid in connection with which an\nFIR came to be lodged against the appellant and his wife, which was \nPage 3 of 27\nregistered as FIR No. 290 of 2015 dated 03.06.2015 at the PS Cantt.\nDistrict, Varanasi under Section 353 of the IPC.\n3.4. On the basis of the said FIR, the appellant was arrested on\n08.06.2015. However, he was granted bail on the same day. Subsequently,\non completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was filed before the Court\nof Chief Judicial Magistrate, Varanasi in connection with the said FIR on\n20.06.2015 alleging commission of offences under Sections 353 and 186\nof the IPC.\n3.5. Pursuant to the filing of the chargesheet, the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Varanasi took cognizance and issued summons to the appellant\nvide order dated 11.08.2015, against which the appellant submitted an\napplication for recalling the said order, which is pending before the Court\nof CJM, Varanasi.\n3.6. According to the appellant, a complaint alleging commission of an\noffence under Section 186 of the IPC would be maintainable only if it is\npreceded by a complaint filed by a public servant as mentioned under\nSection 195 (1)(a) of the CrPC before the court/Magistrate, but there was\nno such prior complaint filed by any public servant before the Magistrate.\nFurther, though the FIR was filed under Section 353 of the IPC,\nthere were no ingredients to make out a case under the said section. It is\nalso the case of the appellant that the authorities had maliciously invoked\nthe penal provision of Section 353 of the IPC in the FIR merely to make\nout a cognizable offence against the appellant to enable the Magistrate to\ntake cognizance, even though there was no case of any assault or use of\ncriminal force by the appellant to deter any public servant from discharging\nhis duty. Hence, taking cognizance of the said FIR by the CJM, Varanasi\nunder Section 353 of the IPC was unwarranted and illegal. \nPage 4 of 27\n3.7 Accordingly, the appellant approached the Allahabad High Court\ninvoking jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC seeking quashing of\nthe aforesaid proceedings, that is, Crime Case No. 290 of 2015 pending\nbefore the CJM, Varanasi and orders taking cognizance and issuing\nsummons in that regard.\n3.8 The Allahabad High Court on perusal of the FIR No.290/15 and the\nstatement of witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC held that a\nprima facie case has been made out against the appellant for being\nsummoned and for prosecution under the aforesaid Sections 353 and 186\nof the IPC and declined his plea for quashing the aforesaid criminal case\nwhich was pending before the CJM, Varanasi.\n3.9 While dismissing the petition filed by the appellant, the Allahabad\nHigh Court referred to an earlier decision of the High Court in rejecting\nthe application filed by the co-accused seeking quashing of the aforesaid\nproceedings under Section 482 of the CrPC which was affirmed by this\nCourt on 13.04.2017 by dismissing the SLP in limine.\nIn the present impugned order, the High Court observed that the\nallegations against the present appellant and co-accused are same as well\nas the evidence collected against them and since the plea of quashing the\ncharge sheet and cognizance taken against the said co-accused had already\nbeen rejected on merits by the High Court, which was not disturbed by this\nCourt, no interference was warranted for quashing the proceedings under\nSection 482 of the CrPC, filed by the present appellant and dismissed the\npetition. Accordingly, the appellant is before us.\nSUBMISSION OF THE APPELLANT\n4. It is the specific plea of the appellant that cognizance in respect of\nan offence under Section 186 of the IPC can be taken by the court only \nPage 5 of 27\nafter a complaint is made in writing by the public servant to the court as\nprovided under Section 195 (1) of the Cr.P.C. It has been submitted that in\nthe present case no such written complaint was filed by any public official\nas also ascertained by him from the concerned authority through an\napplication filed to the competent authority under the Right to Information\nAct, 2005, whereby he was informed that no written complaint was filed\nbefore the court by any public servant in connection with Case No. 9790\nof 2015 (State Vs B.N. John and Anr.).\n4.1 Further, for invoking the provision of Section 353 of the IPC there\nmust be a clear allegation of assault or criminal force by the accused for\npreventing the public servant from discharging his duty. However, a\ncareful reading of the FIR would indicate that no such allegation was made\nagainst the appellant of using criminal force or assault and accordingly,\neven if the allegations made in the FIR are taken at their face value, it does\nnot disclose the commission of any cognizable offence as contemplated\nunder Section 353 of the IPC.\n4.2 Accordingly, it has been submitted that taking cognizance by the\nCJM, Varanasi, of the aforesaid case under the stated facts and\ncircumstances is quite illegal and perverse in law, as such, the same ought\nto have been quashed by the Allahabad High Court. It was contended that\nthe Allahabad High Court, however, had misdirected itself by observing\nthat a prima facie case is made out on the basis of the contents of the FIR\nand the statement of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 CrPC.\n4.3 It has also been contended that the Allahabad High Court in the\npresent case ought not to have taken into consideration the order passed in\nrespect of the other co-accused, as the legal issues as highlighted in this\nappeal, were not considered by the Allahabad High Court while rejecting \nPage 6 of 27\nthe plea of the co-accused for quashing the complaint. As such, the said\ndecision cannot be used against the present appellant.\nPLEA OF THE RESPONDENT\n5. Per contra, it has been submitted on behalf of the State that the\ndecision rendered by the Allahabad High Court is in consonance with the\nlaw and no grievance can be made as the High Court had applied the\nrelevant law to the facts of the present case.\nFurther, it has also been submitted that this Court must be very slow\nin interfering with a reasoned order passed by the High Court, and the\nimpugned order cannot be said to be perverse, illegal, or without any\njurisdiction. It was contended that merely because a different view could\nhave been taken by the High Court, it does not render the decision of the\nHigh Court illegal, warranting interference from this Court, and the High\nCourt passed the order after going through the records.\nANALYSIS\n6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the\nrecord.\n7. As far as quashing of criminal cases is concerned, it is now more or\nless well settled as regards to the principles to be applied by the court. In\nthis regard, one may refer to the decision of this Court in State of Haryana\nVs. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Ors., 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 wherein this Court\nhas summarized some of the principles under which\nFIR/complaints/criminal cases could be quashed in the following words:\n\u201c102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant\nprovisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of\nlaw enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the\nexercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the\ninherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have\nextracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories\nof cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be\nexercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or \nPage 7 of 27\notherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible\nto lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised\nand inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive\nlist of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be\nexercised.\n(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report\nor the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value\nand accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute\nany offence or make out a case against the accused.\n(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and\nother materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not\ndisclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation\nby police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except\nunder an order of a Magistrate within the purview of\nSection 155(2) of the Code.\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or\ncomplaint and the evidence collected in support of the\nsame do not disclose the commission of any offence and\nmake out a case against the accused.\n(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a\ncognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable\noffence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer\nwithout an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under\nSection 155(2) of the Code.\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are\nso absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which\nno prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that\nthere is sufficient ground for proceeding against the\naccused.\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the\nprovisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which\na criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and\ncontinuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a\nspecific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,\nproviding efficacious redress for the grievance of the\naggrieved party.\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with\nmala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously\ninstituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance\non the accused and with a view to spite him due to private\nand personal grudge.\u201d\n (emphasis added)\n8. Of the aforesaid criteria, clauses no. (1), (4) and (6) would be of\nrelevance to us in this case. \nPage 8 of 27\nIn clause (1) it has been mentioned that where the allegations made\nin the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at\ntheir face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute\nany offence or make out a case against the accused, then the FIR or the\ncomplaint can be quashed.\nAs per clause (4), where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute\na cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no\ninvestigation is permitted by police officer without an order dated by the\nMagistrate as contemplated under Section 155 (2) of the CrPC, and in such\na situation, the FIR can be quashed.\nSimilarly, as provided under clause (6), if there is an express legal\nbar engrafted in any of the provisions of the CrPC or the concerned Act\nunder which the criminal proceedings is instituted, such proceeding can be\nquashed.\n9. Our criminal justice system, rooted in the rule of law, contemplates\ndifferent approaches for dealing with serious and non-serious offences.\nWhen complaints pertaining to serious offences are filed, which are\ngenerally categorized as cognizable offences under the CrPC, the police,\non receiving such information of the commission of a cognizable offence\ncan immediately start the investigation as contemplated under Section 156\nof the CrPC. On the other hand, when it relates to non-serious offences\nwhich are generally categorized as non-cognizable offences, the law is\nmore circumspect in letting the full force of the criminal justice system\noperate. When it is related to non-cognizable offence there are certain\nsafeguards put in place so that the invasive, intrusive, and coercive power\nof the police is not immediately brought into operation, as enabled under\nSection 156 of the CrPC. In such a situation any complaint alleging\ncommission of non-serious offence(s) or non-cognizable offence(s) made \nPage 9 of 27\nbefore the police, has to be vetted by a legally trained person in the\npresence of a Judicial Magistrate before the police can initiate the\ninvestigation. Thus, even if the police receives any such complaint relating\nto non-cognizable offence, the police cannot start investigation without\nthere being a green signal from the Magistrate. Further, when such noncognizable offence(s) pertaining to officials who are obstructed from\ndischarging their official duties, there is the additional safeguard before the\nMagistrate which permits the investigating authority to investigate. It must\nbe preceded by a complaint filed by a public servant before the\ncourt/Magistrate. This is to ensure that only genuine complaints relating to\nnon-serious offences or non-cognizable offences are entertained by the\nMagistrate. This is so for the reason that in a democracy, interactions of\nthe citizen with the public servants is more frequent in wherein there may\nbe instances where the members of the public cause obstruction to public\nservants preventing them from discharging public duties properly.\nWith these safeguards, the fine balance between the liberties of the\ncitizens and the imperatives of the State endowed with coercive authority\nto maintain law and order is preserved.\n10. Keeping the aforesaid principles and aspects in mind, we shall\nproceed to examine the issues and contentions of the parties before us.\n11. Chapter XII of the CrPC deals with information given to the police\nand their powers to investigate.\nSection 155 (2) of the CrPC provides that when information is given\nto an officer in charge of a police station of the commission within the\nlimits of such station of a non-cognizable offence, he shall enter or cause\nto be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by such\nofficer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf,\nand refer the informant to the Magistrate. Section 155(2) of the CrPC \nPage 10 of 27\nfurther provides that no police officer shall investigate a non-cognizable\ncase without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such a case or\ncommit the case for trial.\nRelevant portions of Section 155 of the CrPC reads as under:\n\u201c155. Information as to non-cognizable cases and\ninvestigation of such cases.\u2014\n(1) When information is given to an officer in charge of a\npolice station of the commission within the limits of such\nstation of a non-cognizable offence, he shall enter or cause to\nbe entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept\nby such officer in such form as the State Government may\nprescribe in this behalf, and refer the informant to the\nMagistrate.\n(2) No police officer shall investigate a non-cognizable case\nwithout the order of a Magistrate having power to try such\ncase or commit the case for trial.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\nThus, there is a specific bar on the police to investigate any such\nnon-cognizable offence, without the order of a Magistrate.\n12. However, no such bar has been placed when it relates to a\ncognizable offence as provided under Sections 154 and 156 of the CrPC,\nunder which, any officer in charge of a police station may, without the\norder of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case that a court having\njurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have\npower to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XII, as\nreproduced herein below:\n\u201c154. Information in cognizable cases.\u2014(1) Every\ninformation relating to the commission of a cognizable\noffence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police\nstation, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his\ndirection, and be read over to the informant; and every such\ninformation, whether given in writing or reduced to writing as\naforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, and the\nsubstance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such\nofficer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in\nthis behalf:\nPage 11 of 27\nProvided that if \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\u201c156. Police officer\u2019s power to investigate cognizable case.\u2014\n(1) Any officer in charge of a police station may, without the\norder of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which\na Court having jurisdiction over the local area within the\nlimits of such station would have power to inquire into or try\nunder the provisions of Chapter XIII.\n(2) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n13. While Section 155 of the CrPC deals with all non-cognizable\noffences, where the police cannot investigate without a prior order of the\nMagistrate, Section 195 of the CrPC provides additional conditions under\nwhich the Magistrates can take cognizance in respect of certain kinds of\nnon-cognizable offences as mentioned in the said section, which includes\nSection 186 of the IPC with which we are directly concerned, only after a\nwritten complaint is filed by the concerned public servant to the\ncourt/Magistrate.\nRelevant portions of Section 195 of the CrPC read as follows:\n\u201c195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public\nservants, for offences against public justice and for offences\nrelating to documents given in evidence.\n(1) No Court shall take cognizance\u2014\n(a) (i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to\n188 (both inclusive) of the Indian Penal Code, (45 of\n1860), or\n(ii) of any abetment of, or attempt to commit, such\noffence, or\n(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit such\noffence,\nexcept on the complaint in writing of the public servant\nconcerned or of some other public servant to whom he is\nadministratively subordinate;\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\n14. Since, the appellant has been charged for committing offences under\nSections 186 and 353 of the IPC, it may be appropriate to reproduce the\nsame.\nPage 12 of 27\nSection 186 of the IPC reads as follows:\n\u201c186. Obstructing public servant in discharge of public\nfunctions.\u2014Whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in\nthe discharge of his public functions, shall be punished with\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend\nto three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred\nrupees, or with both.\nSection 353 of the IPC reads as follows:\n\u201c353. Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from\ndischarge of his duty.\u2014Whoever assaults or uses criminal force\nto any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty\nas such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that\nperson from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in\nconsequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such\nperson to the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant,\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a\nterm which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.\u201d\n15. A bare perusal of Section 195 (1) of the CrPC clearly indicates that\nthere is a bar on the court to take cognizance of any offence punishable\nunder Section 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the IPC except on a complaint\nin writing made by the concerned public servant to the court. Therefore,\nif it is found as contended by the appellant that in respect of the offence\nunder Section 186 of the IPC against him, no such complaint was filed by\nthe concerned public servant as contemplated under Section 195 (1)(a)\nCrPC, the CJM could not have taken cognizance of the offence under\nSection 186 of the IPC.\nIn this regard, the appellant has specifically pleaded to which there\nis no rebuttal from the State that no such complaint was made in writing\nby a public servant as required under Section 195(1) of the CrPC relating\nto the commission of offence by the appellant under Section 186 of the\nIPC.\nPage 13 of 27\n16. The State has, however, made a feeble attempt to show that there\nwas indeed a complaint filed by the District Probation Officer to the City\nMagistrate, Varanasi, on 03.06.2015, alleging that the appellants and his\nparty were creating obstructions to the officials in the process of sending\nthe minor children residing in the institution run illegally by Sampoorn\nDevelopment India to other approved institutions and requested the City\nMagistrate to take cognizance of the same and take legal action.\nThe aforesaid complaint reads as follows:\n\u201cTo,\nCity magistrate\nVaranasi\nSir,\nBy your order dated June 3, 2015, letter no. 1346, Mr B.N.\nJohn, Ms Susan John and their people are creating obstruction in\nthe process of sending the minor children residing in the non-legal\ninstitution run by the Sampoorna Development Trust to other\nInstitutions legally. Please take cognizance of this and take further\nlegal action.\n Sincerely\n Prabhat Ranjan\n 03/06/2013\nDistrict Probation Officer.\nStation Head Cantt/CO Cantt.\nS/O is creating obstruction in important work necessary action.\u201d\n17. A careful examination of the aforesaid letter, however, would reveal\nthe following crucial aspect.\nThe said letter in the form of complaint is addressed to the City\nMagistrate and not to any Judicial Magistrate. As to what is a complaint is\ndefined under Section 2 (d) of the CrPC which reads as follows:\n\u201c2. Definitions.\u2014In this Code, unless the context otherwise\nrequires,\n(a) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n(b) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n(c) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026..\nPage 14 of 27\n(d) \u201ccomplaint\u201d means any allegation made orally or in writing to\na Magistrate, with a view to his taking action under this Code, that\nsome person, whether known or unknown, has committed an\noffence, but does not include a police report.\nThus, a complaint within the meaning and scope of the Criminal\nProcedure Code would mean such a complaint filed before a Judicial\nMagistrate and not an Executive Magistrate.\n18. As regards the difference between a Judicial Magistrate and an\nExecutive Magistrate, it has been clarified by this Court in Gulam Abbas\nv. State of U.P., (1982) 1 SCC 71 as follows:\n\u201c24. Turning to the 1973 Code itself the scheme of separating\nJudicial Magistrates from Executive Magistrates with allocation of\njudicial functions to the former and the executive or administrative\nfunctions to the latter, as we shall presently indicate, has been\nimplemented in the Code to a great extent. Section 6 provides that\nthere shall be in every State four classes of criminal courts, namely,\n(i) Courts of Session, (ii) Judicial Magistrates of the First class\nand, in any metropolitan area, Metropolitan Magistrates;(iii)\nJudicial Magistrates of the Second Class; and (iv) Executive\nMagistrates; Sections 8 to 19 provide inter alia for declaration of\nmetropolitan area, establishment of Courts of Session, Courts of\nJudicial Magistrates, Courts of Metropolitan Magistrates and\nappointments of Sessions Judges, Additional Sessions Judges,\nAssistant Sessions Judges, Chief Judicial Magistrates, Judicial\nMagistrates, Chief Metropolitan Magistrates and Metropolitan\nMagistrates together with inter se subordination, but all\nappointments being required to be made by the High Court, while\nSections 20, 21, 22 and 23 deal with appointments of District\nMagistrates, Additional District Magistrates, Executive\nMagistrates, Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Special Executive\nMagistrates and their respective jurisdictions in every district and\nmetropolitan area together with inter se subordination, but\nappointments being made by the State Government. Chapter III\ncomprising Sections 26 to 35 clearly shows that Executive\nMagistrates are totally excluded from conferment of powers to\npunish, which are conferred on Judicial Magistrates; this shows\nthat if any one were to commit a breach of any order passed by an\nExecutive Magistrate in exercise of his administrative or executive\nfunction he will have to be challenged or prosecuted before a\nJudicial Magistrate to receive punishment on conviction. Further,\nif certain sections of the present Code are compared with the\nequivalent sections in the old Code it will appear clear that a\nseparation between judicial functions and executive or\nadministrative functions has been achieved by assigning \nPage 15 of 27\nsubstantially the former to the Judicial Magistrates and the latter\nto the Executive Magistrates. For example, the power under\nSection 106 to release a person on conviction of certain types of\noffences by obtaining from him security by way of execution of bond\nfor keeping peace and good behaviour for a period not exceeding\nthree years \u2014 a judicial function is now exclusively entrusted to a\nJudicial Magistrate whereas under Section 106 of the old Code\nsuch power could be exercised by a Presidency Magistrate, a\nDistrict Magistrate or Sub-Divisional Magistrate; but the power to\ndirect the execution of a similar bond by way of security for keeping\npeace in other cases where such a person is likely to commit breach\nof peace or disturb the public tranquillity \u2014 an executive function\nof police to maintain law and order and public peace which was\nconferred on a Presidency Magistrate, District Magistrate, etc.\nunder the old Section 107 is now assigned exclusively to the\nExecutive Magistrate under the present Section 107; Chapter X of\nthe new Code deals with the topic of maintenance of public order\nand tranquillity and in that Chapter Sections 129 to 132 deal with\nunlawful assemblies and dispersal thereof, Sections 133 to 143 deal\nwith public nuisance and abatement or removal thereof, Section\n144 deals with urgent cases of nuisance and apprehended danger\nto public tranquillity and Sections 145 to 148 deal with disputes as\nto immovable properties likely to cause breach of peace \u2014 all being\nin the nature of executive (\u201cpolice\u201d) functions, powers in that\nbehalf have been vested exclusively in Executive Magistrates\nwhereas under equivalent provisions under the old Code such\npowers were conferred indiscriminately on any Magistrate,\nwhether Judicial or Executive. In particular it may be stated that\nwhereas under the old Section 144 the power to take action in\nurgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger to public\ntranquillity had been conferred on \u201ca District Magistrate, a Chief\nPresidency Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other\nMagistrate, specially empowered by the State Government\u201d, under\nthe present Section 144 the power has been conferred on \u201ca\nDistrict Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other\nExecutive Magistrate specially empowered by the State\nGovernment in that behalf\u201d. Having regard to such implementation\nof the concept of separation of judicial functions from executive or\nadministrative functions and allocation of the former to the Judicial\nMagistrates and the latter to the Executive Magistrates under the\nCode of 1973, it will be difficult to accept the contention of the\ncounsel for Respondents 5 and 6 that the order passed by a District\nMagistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other Executive\nMagistrate under the present Section 144 is a judicial or quasijudicial order, the function thereunder being essentially an\nexecutive (police) function. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\nPage 16 of 27\n19. Since the Magistrate referred to under Section 155 under Chapter\nXII of the CrPC refers to a Magistrate who has the power to try such case\nor commit the case for trial and thus exercises judicial function, he has to\nbe a Judicial Magistrate. Further, under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC read\nwith Section 2 (d) of the CrPC, the complaint, has to be filed before the\ncourt taking cognizance, and the complaint which is required to be filed\nunder Section 195 (1) of the CrPC, can only be before a Judicial Magistrate\nand not an Executive Magistrate who does not have the power to take\ncognizance of an offence or try such cases.\n20. In the present case, since the complaint was filed before the City\nMagistrate and not before a Judicial Magistrate, the requirement of Section\n195 (1) of the CrPC was not fulfilled.\n\n21. Under such circumstances, we are satisfied that the appellant has\nbeen able to make out a case that taking cognizance of the offence under\nSection 186 of the IPC by the Court of CJM, Varanasi, was illegal, as\nbefore taking such cognizance it was to be preceded by a complaint in\nwriting by a public servant as required under Section 195(1) of the CrPC.\nA written complaint by a public servant before the court takes cognizance\nis sine qua non, absence of which would vitiate such cognizance being\ntaken for any offence punishable under Section 186 of the IPC.\n22. This leads us to the next consideration as to whether taking\ncognizance of the offence under Section 353 of the IPC by the CJM,\nVaranasi, was in order or not.\n23. For a prohibited act to come within the scope of the offence under\nSection 353 of the IPC, such an act must qualify either as an assault or\ncriminal force meant to deter public servant from discharge of his duty.\nObviously, such an act cannot be a mere act of obstruction which is an \nPage 17 of 27\noffence under Section 186 of the IPC. The offence contemplated under\nSection 353 of the IPC is of a more serious nature involving criminal force,\nor assault which attracts more stringent punishment that may extend to two\nyears. On the other hand, the offence of obstruction covered under Section\n186 of the IPC is punishable by imprisonment, which may extend to three\nmonths at the maximum.\nA close examination of Section 353 of the IPC would indicate that\nto invoke the aforesaid offence, there must be use of criminal force or\nassault on any public servant in the execution of his official duty or with\nthe intent to prevent or deter such public servant from discharging his duty.\nIt would be clear from a reading of the provisions of Section 186 as well\nas Section 353 of the IPC that Section 353 of the IPC is the aggravated\nform of offence where criminal force or assault is involved. Unlike in the\ncase of Section 186 of the IPC where voluntarily obstructing any public\nservant in discharge of his official function is sufficient to invoke the said\nsection, in the case of offence under Section 353 of the IPC as mentioned\nabove, not only obstruction but actual use of criminal force or assault on\nthe public servant is necessary.\n24. In the present case, however, what can be seen from a perusal of the\ncontents of the FIR, is that no such allegation of assault or use of criminal\nforce has been made. The aforesaid FIR is based on the complaint filed by\nthe District Probation Officer, which has already been quoted above, and\nthe same has been reproduced verbatim in the said FIR in which only the\nallegation of creating disturbance has been made.\n25. In the FIR there is no allegation of use of criminal force or assault\nby the appellant so as to invoke the provision of Section 353 of the IPC. It\nis to be remembered that a criminal process is initiated only with the\nlodging of an FIR. Though FIR is not supposed to be an encyclopedia \nPage 18 of 27\ncontaining all the detailed facts of the incident and it is merely a document\nthat triggers and sets into motion the criminal legal process, yet it must\ndisclose the nature of the offence alleged to have been committed as\notherwise, it would be susceptible to being quashed as held in Bhajan\nLal\u2019s case (supra) (vide clause 1 of Para 102 of the decision).\nThis Court in CBI v. Tapan Kumar Singh, (2003) 6 SCC 175\nobserved as follows:\n\u201c20. It is well settled that a first information report is not an\nencyclopaedia, which must disclose all facts and details relating to\nthe offence reported. An informant may lodge a report about the\ncommission of an offence though he may not know the name of the\nvictim or his assailant. He may not even know how the occurrence\ntook place. A first informant need not necessarily be an eyewitness\nso as to be able to disclose in great detail all aspects of the offence\ncommitted. What is of significance is that the information given\nmust disclose the commission of a cognizable offence and the\ninformation so lodged must provide a basis for the police officer to\nsuspect the commission of a cognizable offence. At this stage it is\nenough if the police officer on the basis of the information given\nsuspects the commission of a cognizable offence, and not that he\nmust be convinced or satisfied that a cognizable offence has been\ncommitted. If he has reasons to suspect, on the basis of information\nreceived, that a cognizable offence may have been committed, he is\nbound to record the information and conduct an investigation. At\nthis stage it is also not necessary for him to satisfy himself about\nthe truthfulness of the information\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d\n (emphasis added)\n26. However, a perusal of the FIR in issue does not at all indicate the\ncommission of any crime of use of criminal force or assault by the\nappellant to the public servant, except for the offence of obstruction which\nis punishable under Section 186 of the IPC. As such the ingredients of\noffence under Section 353 of the IPC are clearly absent in the FIR. To that\nextent, we are in agreement with the appellant that since no ingredient for\nthe offence under Section 353 of the IPC is found in the FIR, taking\ncognizance by the CJM of an offence that is not made out in the FIR does\nnot appear to be correct.\nPage 19 of 27\n27. The High Court, however, has held that on a perusal of the contents\nof the FIR and the statement made by the witnesses recorded under Section\n161 of the CrPC, it can be said that a prima facie case has been made out\nagainst the appellant for commission of offences under Section 353 and\nSection 186 of the IPC. It is to be noted that the FIR was filed under Section\n353 of the IPC without mentioning Section 186 of the IPC.\nWhat is to be noted in the present case is that if the appellant had\nactually used criminal force or had assaulted the public servants, which\nwould bring the said acts within the scope of Section 353 of the IPC,\nnothing prevented the complainant from mentioning the same in the FIR\nbeing the first information. If such vital and crucial facts are missing from\nthe FIR of which the complainant was fully aware of and was already\ncognizant of, which he could have mentioned at the first instance, it would\nindicate that any subsequent mentioning of these facts in the case by the\ncomplainant would be an afterthought as has happened in the present case.\nThe alleged fact of assault, or use of criminal force by the appellant could\nnot be said to have been discovered at a later point of time, as these\noffensive acts, if really had happened, would have happened before the\nfiling of the FIR/complaint and thus should have found mention in the FIR.\nThese acts were not something that had happened at a later point of time,\nbut would have been known to the complainant had these happened when\nthe complainant and official party were raiding the hostel managed by the\nappellant. Thus, the absence of mentioning these alleged acts which would\nconstitute ingredients of the offence under Section 353 of the IPC, renders\nthe FIR legally untenable as far as the offence under Section 353 of the\nIPC is concerned. We do not see any reason why the complainant failed to\nmention in the FIR the alleged use of criminal force or assault of the public\nservants to prevent them from discharging their official duties when they\nwere raiding the premises. \nPage 20 of 27\n28. It appears from the impugned order of the High Court that the High\nCourt also perused the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section\n161 of the CrPC during the investigation. We have also gone through these\nstatements made by Sh. Prabhat Ranjan, District Probation Officer; Sh.\nSatyendra Nath Shukla, City Magistrate; Sh. Vindhavasini Rai, Addl.\nDistrict Magistrate; and Sh. Surendra Dutt Singh, ACM-IV.\nWhat is interesting to note is that Sri Prabhat Ranjan, the District\nProbation Officer, Varanasi, who filed the complaint to the City Magistrate\nstated in his statement recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC that the\npeople in the hostel premises attacked the official team, and thereafter, the\nFIR was lodged. However, when the FIR was lodged soon after the alleged\nincident of attack on the officials, nothing was mentioned in the complaint\nfiled by him about the attack, which was the basis for registering the FIR,\nwhich we are unable to comprehend. If indeed there was an attack as\nalleged, it should have found mention in the FIR or the written complaint\nfiled before the City Magistrate soon after the incident.\n29. We have also perused the statement of Sri Satyendra Nath Shukla,\nthe City Magistrate who in his statement recorded under Section 161 of the\nCrPC on 20.06.2015, stated that the people in the hostel premises \u201cwere\ncreating obstruction in the government work in the proceeding being\ncarried out. In such a situation, when asked to submit the records again,\nthe husband, wife and some other people along with them became\naggressive by speaking loudly, due to which, while somehow trying to\nescape, around 5:30 pm, the husband, the wife and others created a\ndifficult situation by obstructing the work, which did not allow the rescue\nto be completed successfully. After this some children were rescued by the\nWomen District Program Officer with the help of the District Horticulture\nofficer, and the children were sent to Ramnagar, after which they were \nPage 21 of 27\nfreed. Then when we asked for the record, Ben John spoke loudly, and his\nwife and other children got very angry and seemed to be intent on\nbecoming forceful. After this, the District Probation Officer came to me\nwith an application regarding obstruction and assault in government\nwork, on which I passed the order and the SHO Cantt registered a case.\u201d\nOn examination of the said statement of the City Magistrate, we are\nof the view that even if the said statement is taken at its face value, it does\nnot disclose any ingredient of criminal force or assault to make the offence\nunder Section 353 of the IPC, except for making a bald statement that they\nwere aggressive without disclosing in what manner the officials were\nobstructed or attacked.\n30. We have also gone through the statement made by Sri Surendra Dutt\nSingh, ACM, 4th District. While he mentions that the appellant and others\nbecame aggressive and attacked all the officers, nothing has been\nmentioned as to how they were attacked, but only a very generalized\nallegation has been made without specifics.\nSimilarly, the other witnesses also stated the same effect.\n31. We do not see any reason why the aforesaid alleged assault or attack\nwas not mentioned in the FIR since soon after the alleged incident\nhappened in the hostel premises, the FIR was lodged. On the other hand,\nthe written complaint to the City Magistrate only uses the expression of\n\u201ccreating obstruction\u201d by stating that \u201cMr. B.N. John, Ms. Susan John and\ntheir people are creating obstruction in the process of sending the minor\nchildren residing in the non-legal institution run by the Sampoorna\nDevelopment Trust to other institutions legally. Please take cognizance of\nthis and take further legal action\u201d. \nPage 22 of 27\n32. There can be no doubt that there is a sea of difference between\n\u201ccreating disturbance\u201d and the \u201cassault\u201d and \u201ccriminal force\u201d terms\nmentioned under Section 353 of the IPC and defined under Sections 350\nand 351 of the IPC respectively.\n\u201cCriminal force\u201d has been defined under Section 350 IPC, which\nreads as follows:\n\u201c350. Criminal force. \u2014Whoever intentionally uses force to any\nperson, without that person's consent, in order to the committing\nof any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or\nknowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause\ninjury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used,\nis said to use criminal force to that other.\u201d\n\u201cAssault\u201d has been defined under Section 351 of the IPC which\nreads as follows:\n\u201c351. Assault. \u2014Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation\nintending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or\npreparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he\nwho makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal\nforce to that person, is said to commit an assault.\nExplanation.\u2014Mere words do not amount to an assault.\nBut the words which a person uses may give to his\ngestures or preparation such a meaning as may make\nthose gestures or preparations amount to an assault.\u201d\n33. If \u201cdisturbance\u201d has to be construed as \u201cassault\u201d or \u201ccriminal force\u201d\nwithout there being specific acts attributed to make such \u201cdisturbance\u201d as\n\u201cassault\u201d or \u201ccriminal face\u201d within the scope of Section 353 of the IPC, it\nwould amount to abuse of the process of law. While \u201cdisturbance\u201d could\nalso be caused by use of criminal force or assault, unless there are specific\nallegations with specific acts to that effect, mere allegation of \u201ccreating\ndisturbance\u201d cannot mean use of \u201ccriminal force\u201d or \u201cassault\u201d within the\nscope of Section 353 of the IPC.\n34. As noted and discussed above, nothing was mentioned in the\ncomplaint/FIR of any specific acts apart from alleging that the appellant \nPage 23 of 27\nand his party were creating disturbance. Nothing has been mentioned how\ndisturbance was created because of assault or use of criminal force.\nThus, the contents of the statements recorded later under Section\n161 of the CrPC clearly appears to be an afterthought and the allegation of\nassault/attack was introduced later on, which is inconsistent with the\ncontents of the original FIR.\n35. Under the circumstances, we are of the view that non mentioning of\nthese vital facts in the FIR/first complaint, which would indicate assault or\ncriminal force within the scope of Section 353 of the IPC, would vitiate\nthe cognizance taken by the CJM. These vital facts, which constitute the\ningredients for offence under Section 353 of the IPC, were not revealed in\nthe FIR. On the other hand, the contents of the FIR would reveal the\ncommission of only non-cognizable offence of obstructing the discharge\nof official duties of public servants, which would fall within the scope of\nSection 186 of the IPC, in which event, without the order of the Judicial\nMagistrate, no investigation could have been launched by the police\nagainst the appellant in the said FIR.\nIt is also to be noted that in the said FIR, Section 186 of the IPC was\nnot even mentioned. We have already found that no complaint was lodged\nby a public servant against the appellant and his party before the\nMagistrate/court alleging commission of offence under Section 186 of the\nIPC as required under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC read with Section 155\nof the CrPC. The written complaint filed by the District Probation Officer\nwas not to a Judicial Magistrate but to an Executive Magistrate, hence was\nnot valid. The police could not have investigated the said offence under\nSection 186 of the IPC. Thus, the very act of taking cognizance at the initial\nstage by the CJM, Varanasi, on the basis of the FIR under Section 353 of\nthe IPC, which does not disclose the ingredients and commission of \nPage 24 of 27\ncognizable offence under Section 353 of the IPC, appears to be contrary to\nlaw. If the initial process is vitiated, the subsequent process would also\nstand vitiated.\nIn State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar (2011) 14 SCC\n770, it was held as follows:\n\u201d107. It is a settled legal proposition that if initial action is not in\nconsonance with law, all subsequent and consequential\nproceedings would fall through for the reason that illegality\nstrikes at the root of the order. In such a fact situation, the legal\nmaxim sublato fundamento cadit opus meaning thereby that\nfoundation being removed, structure/work falls, comes into play\nand applies on all scores in the present case.\n108. In Badrinath v. Govt. of T.N. [(2000) 8 SCC 395 : 2001 SCC\n(L&S) 13 : AIR 2000 SC 3243] and State of Kerala v. Puthenkavu\nN.S.S. Karayogam [(2001) 10 SCC 191] this Court observed that\nonce the basis of a proceeding is gone, all consequential acts,\nactions, orders would fall to the ground automatically and this\nprinciple is applicable to judicial, quasi-judicial and\nadministrative proceedings equally.\u201d\n36. What is evident from the records is that the police entertained the\nFIR under Section 353 of the IPC and investigated the same by conferring\njurisdiction upon itself as if it was a cognizable offence as provided under\nSection 156 of the CrPC, when commission of any cognizable offence was\nnot made out in the FIR, which is not permissible in law. The police added\nSection 186 of the IPC later, and the CJM, Varanasi, took cognizance of\nthe offence of Section 186 of the IPC along with Section 353 of the IPC\nwhen no complaint was made by any public servant to the CJM or any\ncourt as required under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC.\n37. We are mindful of the position that where, during the investigation\nof a cognizable or non-cognizable offence on the basis of an FIR lodged,\nnew facts emerge that will constitute the commission of a non-cognizable\noffence under IPC, in which event, the police can continue with the\ninvestigation of the non-cognizable offence of which there cannot be any\ndispute. \nPage 25 of 27\nThus, even if it is assumed that in the course of the investigation of\na cognizable offence, the ingredients of a non-cognizable offence are\ndiscovered then the police could have continued the investigation without\nthe written complaint to the court or the order of the court in respect of\nsuch non-cognizable offence, as it would also be deemed to be a cognizable\noffence under Section 155(4) of the CrPC, but where the investigation of\nthe cognizable office itself suffers from legal infirmity and without\njurisdiction from the initial stage, the entire investigation would be\nvitiated. For this reason, the police cannot seek the shield under Section\n155 (4) of the CrPC when the FIR did not disclose the commission of a\ncognizable offence.\n38. As discussed above, the offence allegedly committed by the\nappellant as disclosed in the FIR can, at best, be that of a non-cognizable\noffence under Section 186 of the IPC, though Section 186 of the IPC is not\neven mentioned in the FIR. It is evident that Section 186 of the IPC was\nadded subsequently, of which the CJM took cognizance later. The FIR\ndoes indicate that a letter was written by the District Probation Officer to\nthe City Magistrate, but the said letter pertains to the filing of the FIR under\nSection 353 of the IPC and not for offence under Section 186 of the IPC.\nFurther, the said letter dated 03.06.2015 was not addressed to the CJM,\nVaranasi, before whom such a written complaint was supposed to be made\nto enable the Court to take cognizance of the offence under Section 186 of\nthe IPC.\n39. We have also perused the order dated 13.10.2015 passed by the High\nCourt in the earlier case filed by Mrs. Susan John, the co-accused, wherein\nthe High Court declined to quash the charge sheet No. 162 of 2015 dated\n20.6.2015 in the same Case Crime No. 290 of 2015 pending before the\nCourt of CJM, Varanasi, on the ground that perusal of the material on \nPage 26 of 27\nrecord and looking into the facts of the case at that stage, it cannot be said\nthat no offence is made out against the applicant, and all the submissions\nmade at the Bar relate to the disputed questions of fact, which cannot be\nadjudicated by the court under Section 482 of the CrPC, and at that stage\nonly the prime facie case is to be seen in the light of the law laid down by\nthis Court in the cases of R P Kapoor vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 SC\n866; State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal (supra); State of Bihar vs. PP\nSharma, 1992 SCC (Cr) 192; and Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. vs.\nMohd. Saraful Haq and another, 2005 SCC(Cr) 283.\n40. However, it is noticed that the High Court did not examine any of\nthe issues as discussed above in this appeal. The said decision of the High\nCourt was not interfered with by this Court, and the SLP filed against the\nsaid order dated 13.10.2015 was dismissed in limine by this Court.\nThis Court has reiterated that in limine dismissal of a Special Leave\nPetition at the threshold without giving any detailed reasons does not\nconstitute any declaration of law or a binding precedent under Article 141\nof the Constitution. In State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar\n(2011) 14 SCC 770, it was held as follows:\n\u201c113. A large number of judicial pronouncements made by this\nCourt leave no manner of doubt that the dismissal of the special\nleave petition in limine does not mean that the reasoning of the\njudgment of the High Court against which the special leave\npetition had been filed before this Court stands affirmed or the\njudgment and order impugned merges with such order of this\nCourt on dismissal of the petition. It simply means that this Court\ndid not consider the case worth examining for a reason, which\nmay be other than the merit of the case. An order rejecting the\nspecial leave petition at the threshold without detailed reasons,\ntherefore, does not constitute any declaration of law or a binding\nprecedent.\u201d\nWe are, thus, of the view that said decision of the High Court and\ndismissal in limine by this Court will not come in the way of disposal of\nthis appeal on merits. \nPage 27 of 27\n41. Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that taking\ncognizance by the CJM, Varanasi, of the offences under Section 353 of the\nIPC and 186 of the IPC was not done by following the due process\ncontemplated under the provisions of law, and accordingly, the same being\ncontrary to law, all the orders passed pursuant thereto cannot be sustained\nand would warrant interference from this Court.\n42. For the reasons discussed above, we are satisfied that the appellant\nhas been able to make out the case for quashing the criminal proceedings\npending against the appellant before the CJM, Varanasi.\n43. Accordingly, we allow this appeal by quashing Case No. 9790 of\n2015 arising out of Case Crime No. 290 of 2015 under Sections 353 and\n186 of the IPC, under P.S. Cantt, District Varanasi, pending before the\nCourt of the CJM, Varanasi, and the consequent orders passed by the CJM,\nVaranasi in taking cognizance and issuing summon to the appellant.\nConsequently, the impugned order dated 22.09.2023 passed by the\nAllahabad High Court in Application Under Section 482 No. 35311 of\n2023 is also set aside.\n \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026J.\n (B.
